# A Slyly Setting North


_A Slyly Setting North_ is an exploration in experimental narrative built upon the framework created for [Lest Ten Horizons Cry](https://www.mouseandthebillionaire.com/lthc/) Where _Lest Ten Horizons Cry_ hid it's narrative underneath the guise of the analog synthesizer, _A Slyly Setting North_ brings these stories to the forefront. The original handmade, boutique synthesizer is still the physical interface, but with a focus on piecing together a number of stories recorded on video and presented on screen.
